The goal of the [Cash Improvement Proposal (CHIP) process](https://blog.bitjson.com/bitcoin-cash-upgrade-2023/#why-chips) is to coordinate upgrades to Bitcoin Cash without a central authority by developing proposals in a collaborative, public process.

**CHIP maintainers are expected to actively seek out stakeholders and demonstrate widespread ecosystem approval.**

This includes approval from node and virtual machine implementations, wallets, and other open source software projects, educational institutions and community initiatives, and industry actors like exchanges, miners, services, and other businesses.

The following statements have been submitted in support of this CHIP.

> The ‘Bounded Looping Operations’ CHIP got first proposed in 2021, now with the targeted VM limits activated in 2025 the groundwork has been laid to finally incorporate loops into the BCH VM by accurately measuring and limiting script resource usage. Loops are a very elementary concept for programming languages so now that they can be enabled in a straightforward way, we absolutely should. The Bounded loops CHIP research had been completed for years already and represents BCH overcoming dogmas and misconceptions on loops in Bitcoin. Fully support the CHIP and look forward to incorporating loops into CashScript to empower contract developers to create more advanced contracts!

> Another fruit of VM limits CHIP, finally contracts authors can work with transaction totals without having to unroll loops or having to use other error-prone workarounds. Loops will also open the door to implementing many operations that are missing as native functions, such as EC operations and advanced math operations like exponentiation, opening the door for more financial and privacy applications. I fully endorse this CHIP for 2026 activation!

> Looping is a fundamental programming construct that will significantly simplify many contract systems and provide the BCH VM with powerful new capabilities.
>
> With the activation of the BCH VM Limits CHIP in 2025, we now have the safeguards needed to enable looping safely, preventing issues such as infinite loops or resource abuse.

> I endorse “CHIP-2021-05 Loops: Bounded Looping Operations (bd3ebc76)” for 2026 lock-in.
>
> In my view the Loops CHIP makes the Bitcoin Cash VM “Turing-complete within VM limits” ([Linear Bounded Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_bounded_automaton) might be the more correct term). This is very important as it greatly increases the number of useful computations that can be conveniently expressed using the VM. Together with the Functions CHIP, Loops really complete the VM. There is some overlap between these two CHIPs, but they also complement each other and should go in together.
>
> Having implemented the Loops CHIP (in albaVm) my view is that the implementation risk is not higher than other CHIPs we have delivered recently.
>
> Metaprogramming has been brought up as a risk (especially in the context of Functions). Loops also enable metaprogramming by making evaluators like [TurtleVm](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/turtlevm-a-meta-circular-evaluator-for-bitcoin-cash-script-proof-of-concept/1638) more practical. Such evaluators can now be made universal and able to evaluate any size program within VM limits. And as VM limits are relaxed evaluators become more practical. Metaprogramming is evidence of the VM’s growing capability. Turing’s original machine was also capable of hosting Turing machine evaluators, with simulated tapes.
>
> By combining Loops and our existing conditional operators it is possible to implement Functions (in an inefficient & convoluted way). One could even establish TurtleVm as such a function and call out to it from various parts of the contract without having to duplicate the evaluator at every call-site. So with Loops we can have both Functions and OP_EVAL but in an inefficient and hard to audit way. Better to establish an efficient and standard way of doing Functions (the Functions CHIP) and roll out Loops & Functions together. Also note that Loops can be expressed via the recursion provided by the Functions CHIP, but less efficiently.
>
> With Loops and Functions the Bitcoin Cash VM becomes much more capable which opens up for more permissionless innovation. This means that we can have solutions like Quantumroot already in May 2026, instead of having to implement quantum resistance via the CHIP process.

> I wholly endorse CHIP 2024-12 P2S, CHIP 2021-05 Loops, CHIP 2025-05 Functions, and CHIP 2025-05 Bitwise.
>
> P2S - Liberalizes some limits that were only put in place as an emergency measure to plug potential DoS in the early days of Bitcoin BTC (holes that don't exist on BCH anymore). Being able to pay to scripts of up to 201 bytes directly simplifies so much in terms of contracts, and liberalizing lots of the other script limits (such as scriptSig being 10KB now) is extremely critical for smart contract development and only makes sense. Ditto for token commitments having more payload. The VMLimits upgrade of 2025 ensures this liberalization is safe and cannot be abused.
>
> Loops - Very conservative but crucial upgrade to the FORTH-like language that is the BCH VM, allowing for loops in script contract code in a very "forth" way (basically even the op-code names and semantics are ones used in some FORTH dialects). Will make some contract applications much more expressive and act as a form of "compression" to reduce contract bloat. VMLimits ensures loops are bounded and cannot hang anything or abuse computing resources beyond what is normal such as the cost of a signature check. No risk, high reward.
>
> Functions - Similarly, functions allow for code-reuse and reduce contract "bloat". They make some computations that would be awkward or incredibly difficult to achieve without functions, achievable in a single contract or contract series. VMLimits again ensure no abuse is possible. Should make porting contracts from e.g. EVM over to "CashVM" more achievable and tractable. Also makes BCH seem like a "real" programmable money chain and should create some developer delight. No risk, high reward, basically.
>
> Bitwise - Re-enables some op-codes that were emergency-disabled by Satoshi back in the day due to DoS concerns, and also adds a new set of bitwise OPs that didn't exist in original Satoshi Bitcoin that allow for alternate ways of doing bit manipulations (either binary or numeric). Due to the fact that we have VMLimits now to constrain expensive operations, will be zero-risk -- and high reward since bit manipulation is _very_ useful for programming in general and for some specialized BCH contracts in particular.
>
> Therefore I am very proud to have consulted on these CHIPs, to have implemented their proof of concept, and to be a "bcasher" and to see these activated in 2026. It's a wonderful time to be in BCH! Very cool!
>
> So yes. I support these upgrades and look forward to seeing them live on-chain in consensus as of mid-day May 15th, 2026.

> As maintainer of awesomebitcoin.cash, unspent.app, unspent.cash, futurebitcoin.cash and now vox.cash, I (the individual committing code under the github username 2qx) approve of CHIP-2021-05 Loops, CHIP-2024-12 P2S, CHIP-2025-05 Functions, and CHIP-2025-05 Bitwise OPs improvements to the Bitcoin Cash protocol.
>
> Although it has been possible to refer (or pay to) unnamed functions by their hashes, and it's also been possible to use loops by chaining logic as steps across multiple transactions, the work to formalize these capabilities as first-class features (within a single evaluation) should greatly simplify using functions and loops on Bitcoin Cash.
>
> Below are some notes on impacts to active projects.
>
> \#\# Impacts from P2S: pay-to-script Proposal
>
> The P2S CHIP will impact Bitcoin Cash Futures markets, because the active coupon supply is currently being generated from chat messages in token commitments, and the change in maximum token commitment length from 40 to 128 bytes (https://github.com/bitjson/bch-p2s?tab=readme-ov-file#token-commitment-length) reduces the cost to chat from 250 sats per byte to 80 sats per byte.
>
> If activated, P2S will make chatting cheaper in vox channels, and reduce the number of coupons emitted per post, which can be expected to lower yield rates for FBCH series and lower the total locked value (TLV) in short term (T-10k) futures vaults.
>
> The P2S CHIP was released in Dec' 24, the FutureChan contract (controlling vox channels) was designed in Mar' 25. So the change in commitment length was known well in advance. Presumably, because it is an open market, folks will price in the change ahead of time, and sort out who will get the fewer coupons after the CHIP activates with the market.
>
> This source of coupons is currently fairly small, but the market may look very different in six months. Because vox channels emit coupons ten weeks in advance of a future maturing, the market impact wouldn't be until around August 1st 2026.
>
> \#\# Oracle development enabled by Bitwise Operation Codes
>
> The mining app for vox is currently blocked by a lack of bitwise operation codes in the VM.
>
> Each thread of the mining token contract will use bitwise operations to calculate current and previous difficulty targets from the current and previous transaction ids.
>
> Bitwise inversion will map the number of leading zeros on a transaction to a difficulty target. Bit shifts also allow for simple and cheap exponentiation, which will be use (along with OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY) for a difficulty adjustment algorithm.
>
> \# In short, the bitwise operation codes will be very useful for doing math that would otherwise get quite complex.

> Looping as a formal CHIP has been proposed since 2021, and has gone through little change over the years.
>
> While the VM-Limits rules activated in 2025 accommodate some interesting but inefficient "unrolling" workarounds, looping's significant simplification and added flexibility in aggregating over arbitrary-sized transactions is too attractive to dismiss both for GP and BCH ecosystem as a whole.
>
> Importantly, the proposal has seen active demand and discussion over the years, making it less likely to raise unknown vulnerabilities after a potential activation. The aforementioned VM-Limits rules added further confidence to its safety, making runaway resource consumption - a common objection to looping - very unlikely in general.
>
> **General Protocols endorse CHIP-2021-05 Loops for a May 2026 activation.**

> I tentatively endorse locking in the following CHIPs for the Bitcoin Cash 2026 upgrade cycle:
>
> - 2021-05 Loops: Bounded Looping Operations
> - 2025-05 Functions: Function Definition and Invocation Operations
> - 2025-05 Bitwise: Re-Enable Bitwise Operations
>
> Loops, Functions, and Bitwise Operations are critical operations that are found in nearly all programming languages. Thanks to the 2025 BCH "VMLA" (Virtual Machine Limits & Arithmetic) upgrade, these powerful constructs can now be safely introduced with negligible concern for their impact on transaction size or validation time.
>
> These common programming constructs are among the final pieces necessary to realize the completion of Bitcoin Cash as a fully-fledged "peer to peer electronic cash **system**". The BCH VM is a high-performance, Turing complete, perfectly parallelizable system that allows any user to permissionlessly transact with any other user in a provably non-forgeable, trustlessly verifiable manner. While the base layer is primarily focused on being "cash" (money), we must remember that money has many functions complementary to, and in addition to the fundamental "Alice pays Bob" function.
>
> Loops and Bitwise are expected to lock in as-is with widespread approval. However, it is worth highlighting that I am specifically endorsing @bitjson's "2025-05 Functions", NOT the "take 2" or "take 3" alternatives proposed by @cculianu.
>
> While the CHIPs proposed by Calin thoughtfully explore variations to Jason's CHIP, I agree with the conclusive opinion from both authors that Jason's original CHIP is the better option. In my opinion, Jason has sufficiently investigated and addressed any remaining contention with the behavior of OP_DEFINE and OP_INVOKE, including concerns about malicious code mutability, "metaprogramming", delegated invocation, and "data as code".

I will also be advocating as such regarding my involvement internally in Selene, BLISS & BLAZE and don’t anticipate any difficulties there, but this statement is not on behalf of those entities.

>
> As discussed on [The Bitcoin Cash Podcast Episode 157](https://youtu.be/h2xjYjqI7_Y?t=4033), community polling indicates a high appetite for protocol innovation & upgrades - presumably built on the confidence of previous upgrade quality & results. It is very noticeable how the CashTokens upgrade in 2023 is living up to expectations in late 2025. There has been no problems really to speak of & impressive traction/uptake of CashTokens technology. I have a biased favourite project in the BLISS NFT ticket collections, but the success of CashTokens is widespread and compelling. One excellent recent example, congratulations to the Riften Labs team on [recently passing $1M USD TVL on Cauldron](https://x.com/dagur/status/1963906886048022999)! The mounting success of the CashTokens ecosystem speaks to the quality of both research & implementation of BCH upgrades and the community’s ability to make powerful investments in those upgrades without expecting instant gratification. The trend is set to continue in 2026.
>
> Loops, Functions & Bitwise operations are all standard issue features of essentially every programming language ever so I’m glad to see the BCH VM catching up to that standard. Loops demonstrates that yet again the BCH community is able to bypass propaganda & misunderstandings (“Bitcoin VM has no loops”) in a way that other cryptocurrency communities severely struggle to. I was also impressed by the community debate that produced the final products (including iterating Functions from OP_EVAL, different function variations & the removal of lowering base-instruction cost). It is critical for the CHIP process & the work produced to be evaluated & critiqued without contention becoming unresolvable.
>
> I would also like to note I see an underrated value in the P2S CHIP specifically - moving P2S from non-standard relay policy to standard. Especially given the current drama in BTC over [policy/consensus gap exploitation (aka “Node wars” between “Knots/filters” vs “Core/spammers”)](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/non-standard-transactions-out-of-band-miner-submission/1257/24), I see a strong opportunity for BCH to once against front-run potential problems by a research effort (& possibly CHIP) to unify policy/consensus where appropriate or document the status/reasoning and reflect on alternative solutions where not. For instance, perhaps an ABLA/DAA style approach - either by consensus or policy - could be used for minimum fee rates? Needs investigation. BitcoinCashAutist (notable CHIP contributor) also mentioned this in [his 2026 CHIP endorsement](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/2026-layla-upgrade-lock-in-chip-endorsements-thread/1672/3). I encourage readers interested in this initiative to read or contribute to [my Bitcoin Cash Research thread](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/non-standard-transactions-out-of-band-miner-submission/1257) about this topic of non-standard transactions.
>
> In any case, the four endorsed CHIPs combined make a very powerful upgrade. I’m thrilled to see BCH making bold strides forward to accelerate our growing momentum & industry-leading presence in UTXO DeFi. I am also glad to be a part of the momentum around endorsements ([my own endorsement in 2024](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/blog/chip-endorsement-may-2025) was not published until late October) & developer tooling/education (sign up to [BCH BLAZE](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/bchblaze2025/detail)!).
>
> There is also great stuff on the horizon with the [1 minute blocks proposal](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/fablous) continuing [to be discussed](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2025-03-faster-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash/1513/124). I would love to see UTXO Commitments start to be focussed on in more detail & the relay policy ideas mentioned above but that’s simply my wishful thinking - as always, a /someone problem!
>
> Finally, a big thank you to Jason Dreyzehner for his tireless work on these proposals & anyone who has been involved in feedback, review, implementation, testing or assistance of any kind. It’s a team effort and testament to a decentralised community but Jason also deserves specific recognition for his ceaseless effort here. Delivering two enormous upgrades back-to-back is an effort that will resonate through BCH history in perpetuity.
>
> Layla follows CashTokens & Velma in bringing BCH to the forefront of cryptocurrency scriptability and will draw in ever more interested parties as a result. I’m enthused & anticipating activation already!

> Loops have a clear value and their omission in the original VM was, in hindsight, a clear blunder. With the VM limits in place we are in a good position and can safely add loops. I fully endorse CHIP-2021-05 Loops: Bounded Looping Operations for activation in May 2026.

> The 2026 BCH CHIPs - Loops, Functions, P2S & Bitwise - referred to as the "Layla" upgrade, completely unleashes the smart-contract capabilities of #BitcoinCash, making it the single-most sophisticated, UTXO-based, smart-contract chain in existence. This really opens up Defi, the BCH Virtual Machine, and possibly some privacy features in the future, as well. For this reason and FWIW, I fully endorse the 2026 CHIPs being pushed on May 15th, 2026.
